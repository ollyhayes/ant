what happens if heart rate sensor attached after the scan?

what happens if the heart rate sensor 


leaving the application running at all times
	sensor 1 turned on	
	attach or scan
	sensor 1 in use
	at some point detach maybe
	return to top

what happens if two sensors are on at the same time?
	for first attempt, all sensors send, accept it's broken if more than one found
	should we remember which sensor was first connected and only use that?
	should we have some gui, e.g. electron or web - match sensors to bulbs
